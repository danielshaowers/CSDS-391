The biggest obstacle to defeating the enemy soldiers was the ScoutTower, which immediately destroys my soldiers. 

To resolve this, I send one soldier to a location which is only in the sight range of one enemy footman. Then, my soldier returns to the pack of soldiers, and the enemy footman follows. Once my soldier returns, my army all attacks the nearest enemy. 

This strategy repeats until the only enemy left is the tower, when my army (theoretically) would attack the tower all together. This way, I can pick off each enemy one at a time, without being attacked by the enemy tower.

The code ended up being really complex because obviously my strategy required that I check for a lot of conditions, and a lot of loops. 

Overall I'm very proud with how it turned out and I feel pretty comfortable working with Sepia now. The absolute worst part has been the scarcity of documentation. There are so many methods and classes with no explanations or at best a one-sentence explanation of their purpose. It's really frustrating. 

The worst for me was that it was never indicated that you need to use Barracks to build a footman. Why isn't that explained anywhere? 

Why isn't it explained that you use peasants to build barracks? I pretty much just tried every combination until something worked. 

I am keeping a personal log of all these interactions that I am learning, but I shouldn't have to discover things for myself this way. It took hours of experimentation during which I didn't gain anything.
