My Resource agent is designed to build a barracks first preceeded by a footman and a farm. This was to ensure that the Barracks would be built in time before the game ended. 
I also modified the original code to make the peasants collect gold 2 times faster than wood because all the items above required significantly more gold than wood to build.

My attack strategy involved using the footmen and the archers to distract the enemy footman while my ballistas got a chance to get closer to the Tower. 
My footmen were designed to attack an enemy within shooting distance and the archers were assigned an enemy at random to help the footmen in their distraction.
The goal wasn't to make them efficient killers but to give the ballistas more time to kill the tower. 

My only critism about the game is that I wish there were more documentation on what each method does and how the classes relate to one another. I spent a lot of time trying to sipher how things worked 
i.e. you need a barrack to create a footman.
